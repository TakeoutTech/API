Order Service
-------------

Use this service to submit, update, void orders.

For POS integrated orders: Update and Void action can only be performed before the order is submitted into the restaurant's POS system;
and only sites that are configured will accept these actions.

We recommend a daily sync of sites and menus to keep their pricing current.
